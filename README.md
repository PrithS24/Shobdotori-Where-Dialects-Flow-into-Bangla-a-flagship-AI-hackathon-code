# শব্দতরী: Where Dialects Flow into Bangla

Welcome to **শব্দতরী: Where Dialects Flow into Bangla**, a flagship AI hackathon organized by the **Department of Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering (ETE), Chittagong University of Engineering & Technology (CUET)**, as part of **Televerse 1.0**.

**শব্দতরী** challenges participants to develop **automatic speech recognition (ASR) models** that transcribe regional Bangladeshi dialects into standard Bangla text.  

The competition features **audio recordings from 20 regional dialects across Bangladesh**, with the task of transcribing dialectal speech into formal Bangla text evaluated using **Normalized Levenshtein Similarity**.

## Model & Results

For this problem, we used the **[`openai/whisper-medium`](https://huggingface.co/openai/whisper-medium)** model for automatic speech recognition (ASR) of Bangladeshi dialects.

- **Leaderboard Score:** 0.77348 (Normalized Levenshtein Similarity)  
- **Position:** 49th out of 63 participants  

This model was selected for its strong performance in multilingual and low-resource speech recognition tasks.
